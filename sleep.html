	“To the first of these points, we have discovered that REM sleep exquisitely <b class="bigger">recalibrates and fine-tunes the emotional circuits of the human brain.</b> In this capacity, REM sleep may very well have accelerated the richness and rational control of our initially primitive emotions, a shift that I propose critically contributed to the rapid rise of Homo sapiens to dominance over all other species in key ways.”

	“After my lecture, a distinguished looking gentleman with a kindly affect, dressed in a tweed suit jacket with a subtle yellow-green hue that I still vividly recall to this day, approached me. It was a brief conversation, but one of the most scientifically important of my life. He thanked me for the presentation, and told me that he was a pianist. He said that he was intrigued by my description of sleep as an active brain state, one in which we may review and even strengthen those things we have previously learned. Then came a comment that would leave me reeling, and trigger a major focus of my research for years to come. “As a pianist,” he said, “I have an experience that seems far too frequent to be chance. I will be practicing a particular piece, even late into the evening, and I cannot seem to master it. Often, I make the same mistake at the same place in a particular movement. I go to bed frustrated. But when I wake up the next morning and sit back down at the piano, <br><b class="bigger">I can just play, perfectly.”</b><br>...perhaps it was practice, with sleep,<br>that makes perfect?”

	“Ask an engineer what the essential properties of a basic electrical switch are, and they will inform you of an imperative: the switch must be definitive. <b class="bigger">It must either be fully on or fully off-a binary state.</b> It must not float in a wishy-washy manner between the on and off positions. Otherwise, the electrical system will not be stable or predictable. Unfortunately, this is exactly what happens to the sleep-wake switch in the disorder of narcolepsy, caused by marked abnormalities of orexin.”
