		<div class="header4">PROJECT OVERVIEW</div>
		<div class="bodytext">
		When NPR relaunched its news app in 2018, the playlist feature was removed from the design. Based on feedback and vocal support for the playlist, the decision was made to bring back the playlist and the design team quickly created a set of designs that needed to undergo testing.
		<br><br>
		I worked with a project manager and senior designer on NPR's iOS playlist feature, and coded a native iOS prototype for user testing. I coordinated with our user testing facilitors at Applause to install the iOS build on our volunteer's devices.

	 <div class="bodytext">We were taking a feature that had existed previously so it was crucial to recruit users familiar with our previous app. We created a native iOS prototype that NPR power users would be able to download, from anywhere in the country.</div>

  	 <div class="header3">Final Thoughts</div>
 	 <div class="header4">VALUES OF A CODED PROTOTYPE</div>
  	 <div class="bodytext">
 	 Because the elements on the prototype were essentially real objects within the app, users didn't have to follow a specific path to access one particular screen. The prototype offered real iOS features such as a functional tab bar with separate screens, buttons with working outlets, and the key feature for testing: a playlist where one could add items and edit in real time. As a native iOS app, the prototype resembled our concepts closely with a smooth user experience and responsive touch gestures. This also benefited our user testing process as our user testing moderator was also able to keep the script vague enough for the users to explore and discover features for themselves.

 	 <div class="header4">TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES</div>
 	 <div class="bodytext">
 	 	As with all things in development, not everything was functional in the prototype. I needed to account for a range of difficult issues, from encountering development bugs to considering the different iOS devices that users owned. Helping users onboard with the app was also tricky - thankfully I was able to host this app with the help of our user testing providers at Applause.

 	 <div class="header4">WORK EFFICIENCY</div>
 	 <div class="bodytext" style="padding-bottom: 10px">
 	 	In terms of the actual coding, I learned to value my work efficiency - I learned keyboard and Xcode shortcuts and tools for debugging, as well as routinely reflecting on how to improve my debugging process. Given the short timespan of the project, I needed to find a balance between both creating a quick and dirty prototype and methodically stepping through my bugs so that it wouldn't be costly in the long run. Through this detailed process, I learned the importance of code design. It wasn't just about having my program compile, it wasn't even about having the program work-my code needed to retain a clear and readable structure for future development. <br><br>
 	 	At the end of the day, a prototype is there to help communicate ideas with your users more easily and help your team identify the pain points that you're looking to solve. For our team and the resources we had on hand, it made the most sense to use the coded prototype, and we were able to receive the valuable feedback we needed. It was really exciting to see users take what I had made and be able to utilize the features as if they were the real thing, and I'm looking forward to the future development of the playlist feature!
